You can open this email in Thunderbird (if you have it) but running the following command in the shell.
(Assuming Linux. In Windows you may need different quoting of special characters.)

<label for="thunderbird-command">Thunderbird command:</label>
<sl-input readonly id="thunderbird-command" style="width: 90%;"></sl-input>
<sl-copy-button from="thunderbird-command.value"></sl-copy-button>
